## [Description](#description)
The task is to take given starter code and convert it into a working `Node.js command-line application`. This application will take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then `generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person`. You have been provided with tests, so make sure `every part of your code passes each provided test`.

The application can be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
`node index.js` and carry out test using `npm run test`
```
## [User-Story](#user-story)

* As a manager a user want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that a user have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

## [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria)
* Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
* When a user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
  * The title of my project 
  * Description 
  * Table of Contents 
  * Installation 
  * Usage 
  * License 
  * Contributing 
  * Tests 
  * Questions

* When a user enters the project title then it is displayed as the title of the README
* When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
* When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled **License** that explains which license the application is covered under
* When a user enters their GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
* When a user enters their email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions
* When a user clicks on the links in the **Table of Contents** then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README

## [Installation](#installation)

* Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.

* Make sure that your repo includes a `package.json` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies. Then install 'inquirer' package.
